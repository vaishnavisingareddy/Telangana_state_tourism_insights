# Telangana_state_tourism_insights
This project helps the authority to take better data informed decisions.
- Cleaning Data
- Spotting any Outliers
- analyising them
and then I made dashboards which could help stakeholders to understand and help them take better decisions.
TOOLS I USED:
I used python and excel for cleaning my data.
power BI for analyising and making Dashboards.
later I used SQL for cross checking the results.

this is a part of codebasics resume challenge.
